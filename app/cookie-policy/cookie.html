  <h1><strong>Cookie Policy</strong></h1>
  <h2><strong>Effective Date: August 29, 2024</strong></h2>
  <p>
    InboxRadarAI ("InboxRadarAI," "we," "us," or "our") is committed to
    protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience on our
    website, applications, and while using our services. This Cookie Policy
    explains how we use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when
    you visit our platforms. It explains what these technologies are and why we
    use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.
  </p>
  <h2><strong>What are cookies?</strong></h2>
  <p>
    Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile
    device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners
    to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to
    provide reporting information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, InboxRadarAI) are called
    "first party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner
    are called "third party cookies." Third party cookies enable third party
    features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g.,
    advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these
    third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the
    website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.
  </p>
  <h2><strong>Why do we use cookies?</strong></h2>
  <p>
    We use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies
    are required for technical reasons in order for our websites and services to
    operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary"
    cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of
    our users to enhance the experience on our platforms. Third parties serve
    cookies through our websites for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our
    Services and their purposes include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Essential Website Cookies: </strong>These cookies are strictly
        necessary to provide you with services available through our Websites
        and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Performance and Functionality Cookies: </strong>These cookies
        are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Websites
        but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies,
        certain functionality may become unavailable.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Analytics and Customization Cookies: </strong>These cookies
        collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us

        marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Websites for you.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Advertising Cookies:</strong>These cookies are used to make
        advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like
        preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads
        are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases selecting
        advertisements that are based on your interests.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Social Networking Cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to
        enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting on our
        Websites through third party social networking and other websites. These
        cookies may also be used for advertising purposes too.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2><strong>How can I control cookies?</strong></h2>
  <p>
    You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can
    exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the Cookie
    Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which
    categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be
    rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and on
    our website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website
    though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be
    restricted.
  </p>
  <h2><strong>How often will you update this Cookie Policy?</strong></h2>

    We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for
    example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or
    regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly
    to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.

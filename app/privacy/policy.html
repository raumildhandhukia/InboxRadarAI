      <strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong
      ><em
        >We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the
        purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by
        law.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary
      for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention
      period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other
      legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping
      your personal information for longer than the period of time in which
      users have an account with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
      information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if
      this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has
      been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
      information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
      possible.

    <p>

      ><em
        >We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
        organizational and technical security measures.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
      organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
      personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
      efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
      Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
      secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or
      other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security
      and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
      Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
      transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your
      own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

        regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK),
        Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access
        to and control over your personal information.&nbsp;You may review,

      >
    </p>
    <p>
      In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have
      certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include
      the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal
      information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict
      the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data
      portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In
      certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the
      processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by
      contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section
      "<strong>HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</strong>" below.
    </p>
    <p><br class="ProseMirror-trailingBreak" /></p>
    <p>
      We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable
      data protection laws.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully
      processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain
      to your
      <strong>Member State data protection authority</strong> or&nbsp;<strong
        >UK data protection authority</strong
      >.
    </p>
    <p><br class="ProseMirror-trailingBreak" /></p>

      If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the
      <strong>Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner</strong>.
    </p>
    <p><br class="ProseMirror-trailingBreak" /></p>
    <p>
      <strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your
      consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or
      implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to
      withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any
      time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section

      updating your preferences.
    </p>
    <p><br class="ProseMirror-trailingBreak" /></p>
    <p>
      However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the
      processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it
      affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance
      on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

      problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or
      comply with applicable legal requirements.

    <p><strong>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>
    <p>
      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
      applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
      activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
      online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no
      uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
      has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
      signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice
      not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
      that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice
      in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
    </p>
    <p><br /><br class="ProseMirror-trailingBreak" /></p>
    <p>
      California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser
      DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard
      for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this
      time.
